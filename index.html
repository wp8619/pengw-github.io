                        <br><h1>Peng Wang</h1><br>

                        Peng is a lecturer (assistant professor) with School of Computing and Information Technology at University of Wollongong. Prior to joinging UOW, he was a research fellow with Auatralian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), The University of Adelaide.
                        He obtained his PhD from School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, The University of Queensland.
                        
            

                        <br><br>

                        His research interests lie broadly in computer vision and machine learning. His current research focuses on learning in realistic scenarios, including but not limited to
                        long-tail learning, open-ended learning, and learning with limited human annotation.
